# R Cafe  August - prepare your script without the data at hand 

## Intro 
In the edition of [R Cafe](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/library/research-data-management/r/training-events/training-for-researchers/tu-delft-r-cafe), we are exploring the ways of preparing yourself to work we a dataset that you don't have at hand.

## Motivation for this session
There are a few researchers at the TU Delft Architecture and the Built Environment faculty that are going to work with CBS data in a remote environment. They don’t have access to the data at the moment and there’s no way to retrieve the data from the remote. They would like to prepare for the analysis beforehand, and they’re wondering if it’s possible to do so without the data. As there’re more use cases for this dilemma (e.g. working with the company data only on company’s site), we decided it’s a good topic for a session.

# Structure of the session
1. Introduction of the problem and how to tackle it
2. List of tips with live code 
3. Experience and lessons-learned from a real-life example. 
4. Discussion
